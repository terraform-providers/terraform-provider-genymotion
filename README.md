1. Existing released binaries will remain available on the releases site.
1. Issues and pull requests are not being monitored.
1. New releases will not be published.

If anyone from the community or an interested third party is willing to maintain it, they can fork the repository and [publish it](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/providers/publishing.html) to the Terraform Registry.

Requirements
------------

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10+
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.12 (to build the provider plugin)

Developing the Provider
---------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (please check the [requirements](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-genymotion#requirements) before proceeding).

*Note:* This project uses [Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) making it safe to work with it outside of your existing [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH). The instructions that follow assume a directory in your home directory outside of the standard GOPATH (i.e `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`).

Clone repository to: `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $HOME/development/terraform-providers/; cd $HOME/development/terraform-providers/
$ git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-genymotion
...
```

Enter the provider directory and run `make tools`. This will install the needed tools for the provider.

```sh
$ make tools
```

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-genymotion
...
```

Using the Provider
----------------------

To use a released provider in your Terraform environment, run [`terraform init`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) and Terraform will automatically install the provider. To specify a particular provider version when installing released providers, see the [Terraform documentation on provider versioning](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#version-provider-versions).

To instead use a custom-built provider in your Terraform environment (e.g. the provider binary from the build instructions above), follow the instructions to [install it as a plugin.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-a-plugin) After placing it into your plugins directory,  run `terraform init` to initialize it.

For either installation method, documentation about the provider specific configuration options can be found on the [provider's website](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/genymotion/index.html).

Testing the Provider
---------------------------

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run. Please read [Running an Acceptance Test](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-genymotion/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-an-acceptance-test) in the contribution guidelines for more information on usage.

```sh
$ make testacc
```
